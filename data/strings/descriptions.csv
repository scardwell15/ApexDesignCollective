# Ships,,,,,
apex_apex,SHIP,"An extremely formidable warship designed to engage the heaviest capitals the Domain ever produced, the Summit-class battleship serves as the Collective's answer to the Paragon, offering massive firepower and durability for a correspondingly high price.

Widely viewed as the Collective's flagship, the Summit makes use of every trick the Fleet Design engineers had in their books. Nearly every component is standardized and designed for ease of maintenance, and large portions of the warship can be replaced without even opening a toolbox. This, of course, only makes the Summit easy to maintain, not cheap. Summits are fairly rare due to their cost and relative impracticality- while they offer stupendous firepower and extreme durability, they cannot keep up with faster battlecruiser fleets. As a result, they mainly see service in defense fleets, guarding jump points and population centers.",,,
apex_apotheosis,SHIP,"An aging battlecruiser in the process of being phased out in favor of the heavier and more modern Eidolon, the Apotheosis is a pocket battlecruiser primarily intended as a cruiser killer, rather than a frontline capital warship. Its high mobility means that smaller ships have a difficult time escaping its large frontal guns.

To avoid overlapping designs, the Apotheosis was developed concurrently with the Summit-class battleships. This allowed engineers to pile bulk onto the Summit, while keeping the Apotheosis as light as possible. As a result, it is one of the smallest, cheapest, and fastest capital warships available in the Persean Sector. Today, however, the Apotheosis has been mostly phased out in favor of the newer Eidolon, with hulls being swapped out as the newer battlecruisers leave the shipyards.",,,
apex_spectrum,SHIP,"Taking advantage of the freighter-like internal volumes required for hangar bays and fighter nanoforges, the Spectrum's bays are self-contained modules, and can be easily swapped out for fuel tanks or cargo containers.

Unsurprisingly, much of the difficulty in maintaining starships comes from the sheer variety of hulls in service. Different ships require different tools and training, even among ships from the same manufacturer. Recognizing this as an inevitable problem, the Fleet Design Bureau consolidated their logistics and carrier hulls into a single vessel. While the crew training for a Spectrum is somewhat more involved than most other ships (as they must know cargo, fuel, and strikecraft procedures), this consolidation saves significant amounts of time overall.",,,
apex_alligator,SHIP,"An evolution of the ancient ""Cruiser School"" doctrine, the Alligator is designed to function as a capable and flexible line cruiser.

The Collective's Fleet Design Bureau settled on a jack-of-all trades cruiser to make up the mainstay of the Apex fleet. Several capabilities were sacrificed to make the Alligator as logistically efficient as possible, including an advanced temporal shell, though some of these devices would later be engineered into other Apex vessels. 

Like most Apex vessels, Alligators are remarkably easy to maintain thanks to a variety of features. Rumor states that Design Bureau departments have an ongoing competition to see exactly how standardized a ship can be made- the Alligator in particular only has three different sizes of screws in it, and four different sizes of bolts.",,,
apex_caiman,SHIP,"An advanced destroyer that focuses on forward firepower and durability, the Caiman is effective at supporting larger ships, but falters when faced with numerous targets.

Previous versions of the Caiman's design have existed since before the Collapse, and are rumored to have even competed for the same contract as the Sunder. Prior to the collapse, these designs saw relatively little usage, with faster, more versatile destroyers holding the attention of Domain admirals. Post-collapse, it was quickly rushed into production by Collective self-defense forces, serving as an anti-capital weapons platform in the labor wars. Today, the modernized version of the Caiman is a cheap and durable way of getting capital-grade firepower onto the battlefield.",,,
apex_agama,SHIP,"A moderately armed frigate with a fantastic top speed thanks to a quick-cycle travel drive, the Agama is ideal for scouting, picket duty, and other roles that require extreme long-range speed.

The Agama was the first post-revolution Apex design to be put into true mass production. Its low production cost makes it cheap enough to serve as the ""worker's warship,"" and is thus available for private purchase all across the Collective. While it barely matches other similar frigates in terms of firepower, its superb travel speed makes it excellent for capturing comm relays and other points of tactical interest, and makes it quite popular for racing.",,,
apex_lacerta,SHIP,"A heavily armed frigate designed to engage and destroy other high-performance frigates. Oriented towards a defensive role, the Lacerta relies on careful use of its Arcmine Dispenser to intercept incoming fighters and missiles.

Suffering from an uptick in pirate activity coinciding with the Second AI War, the Defense Force issued an urgent requirement for a new escort craft capable of both running down frigates and holding its own against larger ships. While the Design Bureau had previously eschewed high-end frigates (and focused on developing ultra-heavy fighters instead), they acquiesced and eventually produced the Lacerta-class frigate. More than capable of shredding the various skirmishers found in pirate fleets, the new heavy frigates quickly became a welcome sight for convoy commanders.",,,
apex_mamba,SHIP,"A modern phase frigate with relatively low logistical overhead, the Mamba is effective and versatile, but generally unremarkable aside from its unique point defense system.

Phase coils are well-known for producing a variety of exotic mental illnesses, particularly among those who experience numerous rapid phase dives or prolonged phase exposure. The Domain military procurement apparatus was certainly aware of this (evidenced by their repeated attempts to suppress that fact), but simply took the occasional psychotic break as the price of doing business. For the Collective, such callousness is anathema, and the Fleet Design Bureau poured fortunes into producing a phase coil that was acceptably safe. As a result, the Collective's phase ships use an exotic low-intensity phase coil design that produces a ""shallower"" phase depth. This enormously reduces the side effects on the crew, and Collective phase ships are known for having extremely gentle dives.

In the Collective, postings to a phase ship are extremely competitive. This is not due to any high standards for phase crews, but rather the so-called ""holy grail"" of union-negotiated bonuses and overtimes- timeflow pay, phase pay, combat pay, and zero-g pay. As a result, a single combat tour on a Collective phase ship can net a crewman nearly triple what they'd make in a year. Unsurprisingly, this is also why Collective phase ships make heavy use of automation.",,,
apex_najash,SHIP,"The Najash is a high-performance troop transport designed to deliver a load of marines at maximum possible velocity, giving targets little time to react. An integrated air-to-ground weapon suite ensures that any landing zone is secured before troops are deployed.

Najash-class dropships are a modern development from the Fleet Design Bureau, designed with extensive input from seasoned marines and ground commanders. Despite its short service life so far, it has a positive reputation among marines for its sheer number of air-to-ground weapons, and the surprising comfort of its accommodations. Fleet commanders may complain that it has no space-capable weaponry, but the marines it carries are usually all too happy to hear that they won't be seeing void combat.",,,
apex_apotheosis_rg,SHIP,"A variant of the Apotheosis-class battlecruiser intended for export to the Revolutionary Council, this ship has had nearly all of its advanced technology removed. As a result, little formal training is required to operate the vessel. Though less suited for the high-power weapons favored by the Collective's fleet doctrine, it is an ideal ship for ragtag Council fleets with a lack of capital firepower.

The Collective generally doesn't sell large military hulls or weapons on the open market, but it does engage in some limited arms trade with ideologically-aligned polities. Their Red Guard line of export variants is one such example- unlike most other ships used by the Council, these ships are purpose-built, and come out of Granite's orbital shipyards with their signature red livery already applied.",,,
apex_gharial,SHIP,"Designed to efficiently deal with enemy frigates, the Gharial outguns and outruns smaller craft, but lacks the armament to comfortably take on other destroyers.

One of the oldest hull designs still in use by the Defense Force, the first iterations of the Gharial-class destroyers left the Granite shipyards nearly a century ago. Intended to protect convoys and small transports from raiding parties, their captains have a reputation for aggression far beyond what would be expected for a simple convoy escort.",,,
apex_crocodile,SHIP,"A departure from classic missile cruiser designs, the Crocodile provides powerful sustained fire support and suppression rather than strike damage. 

The centerpiece of the Crocodile's armament, Taipan VLS pods were designed as defensive emplacements for stations, intended to fire enormous waves of kinetic missiles to overwhelm point defences and cripple shields. While the Collective never ended up building its own station designs, the missile pods were worked into the Crocodile-class missile cruisers. Further refinements produced additional missile varieties and an extremely capable (though computationally-intensive) tracking algorithm. As part of the Design Bureau's continued dedication to making ship maintenance as easy as possible, the pods themselves are held in place by large locking lugs rather than welds or bolts, and can thus be swapped out for different ones with ease.",,,
apex_eidolon,SHIP,"A shockingly mobile battlecruiser designed as a premier hunter-killer, the Eidolon is widely feared by Tri-Tachyon cruiser and destroyer captains, who frequently become the unfortunate victims of its fearsome frontal armament.

The Eidolon was long considered a fanciful pet project of the Fleet Design Bureau's Capital Warship Department, with little hope of it ever entering full deployment. However, following an uptick in raider activity and several production surpluses, it was finally put into full serial production in 195 AC, much to the surprise of its designers. Today, it has mostly replaced the aging Apotheosis-class battlecruisers in Collective fleets.",,,
apex_komodo,SHIP,"The only asymmetrical ship in Collective service, the Komodo is a lumbering heavy cruiser that can easily go toe-to-toe with anything smaller than a capital. Designed to trade blows with other frontline combatants, it is fantastically durable, but lacks the speed to finish off faster targets.

Designed during a time when long-range patrols were in vogue among Defense Force strategists, the Komodo's combination of large size, extensive automation, and small crew complement makes it one of the more luxurious ship classes CDF crewmembers can be assigned to. While it lacks the sort of amenities one might expect on a station or heavy capital ship, its spacious cabins make the hull one of the CDF's more popular postings.",,,
apex_python,SHIP,"A superheavy phase cruiser, the Python is the Collective's answer to the Doom. While it has more than enough armament to match its competitors, its low-intensity phase coils favor a more standoffish and methodical approach to combat than a traditional phase warship.

Far more exotic than most other technology employed by Collective fleets, the Python's Bifurcation Device is a minor point of friction between the Collective and Hegemony inspection teams. In the Collective's view, the Device uses n-brane manipulators to create pockets of space with non-integer dimensions, producing temporary fractal ""afterimages"" of projectiles. In the view of less permissive (or perhaps less educated) Hegemony inspectors, this is meaningless technobabble and the Device is simply a gross violation of causality. Nevertheless, the Hegemony has so far been willing to turn a blind eye as long as Pythons continue racking up kills against Pathers, pirates, and unfortunate Tri-Tachyon raiders.",,,
apex_backscatter,SHIP,"Rather boxy compared to the aggressive designs of other Collective warships, the Backscatter is nonetheless a capable carrier. Like the Spectrum, its hangar bay is modular and can be swapped out for a fuel tank or cargo compartment.

While the heavier Spectrum carriers usually make up the mainline fighter platforms of Collective fleets, it was realized that a smaller carrier was important for patrol duties. Instead of creating an entirely new design, the Design Bureau based the Backscatter on heavy orbital construction drones, adding armor, crew quarters, a hyperspace engine, and replacing the fixed cargo compartment with a modular slot.",,,
apex_photon_c,SHIP,"A tiny military cargo transport, the Photon is attractive purely for its blistering top speed and near-total immunity to interception. Even if an enemy fleet manages to wrangle it into combat, its quick-cycle travel drive usually allows it to escape unharmed. Should it be caught by anything larger than another shuttlecraft, however, the Photon is incapable of putting up much of a fight.",,,
apex_photon_f,SHIP,"A tiny military tanker, the Photon is attractive purely for its blistering top speed and near-total immunity to interception. Even if an enemy fleet manages to wrangle it into combat, its quick-cycle travel drive usually allows it to escape unharmed. Should it be caught by anything larger than another shuttlecraft, however, the Photon is incapable of putting up much of a fight.",,,
apex_photon_p,SHIP,"A tiny military shuttlecraft, the Photon is attractive purely for its blistering top speed and near-total immunity to interception. Even if an enemy fleet manages to wrangle it into combat, its quick-cycle travel drive usually allows it to escape unharmed. Should it be caught by anything larger than another shuttlecraft, however, the Photon is incapable of putting up much of a fight.",,,
apex_excession,SHIP,"A hyper-advanced prototype vessel designed to engage entire fleets, the Excession represents a quantum leap in the Collective's engineering capabilities. For most captains, this is a kind of ship that they'll only encounter once, and typically in the same way that a sentence encounters a period.

The Excession's development history is highly classified, and the ship's databanks contain no information beyond the standard operating procedures. It appears to be the product of further refinement of the Collective's armor and phase technology, though it's unclear how such major advances were produced so quickly. Some components bear clear lineage to other Collective warships, particularly the Mamba-class frigates. Others are much more esoteric, labeled with strong warnings against disassembly and serviced only by automated repair drones.

Almost disappointingly, the interior of the ship bears little resemblance to the various rumors of ""superships"" bouncing around the hypernet. Indeed, the bridge and other habitable areas are practically unchanged from other Collective warships, bearing the same simple but comfortable utilitarian design. An inspection of the ship's internals reveals a different picture. At close range, a scan penetrates the ship's integrated sensor baffles and ultradense armor lattice to reveal a captured hyperspace breach, wrangled into unhappy cooperation by more than a dozen capital-grade shield emitters. 

While Domain technology certainly made use of hyperspace physics (particularly the stellar-scale hypershunts that it used to harvest power from stars), directly harvesting energy from hyperspace appears to be a novel invention. Academics and unlucky captains have long known that hyperspace storms are highly energetic, but actually deriving power from them was largely considered unneccessary or more effort than it was worth, since the primary concern with starships is flux disposal, not power generation.",,,
apex_sunbeam,SHIP,"A departure from typical Collective design practices, the Sunbeam is a massive battlecarrier intended for demolishing hostile battlestations and operating away from friendly territory for extended periods. 

Repairing damaged vessels in transit is a fairly dangerous task. Micrometorite impacts, blueshifted radiation, and space debris exact a heavy toll on repair drones. Worse, there is little reason to rectify this- bringing a dedicated repair ship wastes supplies or fuel that can be spent on additional warships. To help rectify this issue, the Design Bureau inserted dedicated repair facilities and drone fabricators in the Sunbeam, widening its frame to prodigious proportions in order to produce a combination combat and logistics ship. The end result is certainly effective, regardless of jokes about how much the ship enjoys eating every enemy projectile headed its way.",,,
apex_tuatara,SHIP,"The Tuatara's design started life as an immobile station-defense drone, intended to provide long-range fire support and point defense. After the Collective shelved plans to construct their own battlestations, the Tuatara was given new life as a support destroyer by hastily expanding the rear section to fit combat-grade engines. cargo space, and a crew compartment.

The core component of the Tuatara is its Thunderstorm Strategic Long-Range Missile (SLRM; affectionately referred to as ""slurm""). Outmassing most fighters, these enormous missiles mount an powerful engine and carry a payload of nearly two dozen specialized bomblets. Unfortunately, volatility issues with the drive result in the destruction of the submunitions if the missile's casing is breached before separation.",,,
apex_iguana,SHIP,"A medium frigate that follows in the footsteps of the popular Crocodile-class missile cruisers, the Iguana carries a quartet of Taipan VLS cells alongside an adequate modular armament.

Designed in response to the lack of a medium-weight standard combat frigate, the Iguana entered service without much fanfare in 189AC. ",,,
apex_goanna,SHIP,"Equipped with powerful engines and a heavy armament, Goannas are intended to function as high-end pursuit ships and flagships for subcapital fleets. 

The Goanna represents the peak development of a less-popular, old-fashioned line of thought within the Fleet Design Bureau. Eschewing the complex physics of spacetime manipulation favored in modern CDF warships, the Goanna relies on iterative development of well-understood technologies. Powerful engines, high-efficiency flux systems, and integrated weapon accelerators lack the flashing lights and exciting math of more esoteric devices, but still deliver just as much combat effectiveness.",,,
apex_anaconda,SHIP,"Larger than any other production phase warship, the Anaconda's hulking form is a rare sight in Collective fleets. Usually employed for highly classified or off-the-books operations, the battlecruiser has only recently entered broader service with the CDF.

Prior to the development of the Anaconda, the Python-class phase cruisers represented the pinnacle of Collective phase technology, employing a whopping 34 individual phase coils in order to drag the heavy cruiser into and out of phase. This was, at the time, the limit of Collective phase technology; while quite advanced (Tri-Tachyon phase designs struggled to exceed a half dozen of their larger, higher-energy coils), it was thought to be a hard limit on phase ship size. Reportedly, however, within the last several cycles Collective scientists have achieved a breakthrough in phase technology that increases the limit to several hundred coils. Rumor has it that the Anaconda, with its massive set of 90 coils, is far from the largest possible phase ship the Design Bureau could produce, but rather that it is simply the largest phase ship that they had practical use for. Unfortunately, details remain scarce, and the CDF's Military Intelligence Branch takes particular interest in spacers who ask too many questions about phase technology in dockside bars.

Like other Collective phase warships, the Anaconda has a full-universal slot layout in order to provide the greatest possible flexibility for commanders. Unfortunately, a particularly limited amount of internal space precludes an all-missile loadout. To compensate, the vessel has a quartet of dedicated nanoacid torpedo tubes nestled into its armored prow, complete with their own ammunition autoforges. At maximum rate of fire, the launchers can dispense a total of twelve torpedoes in three seconds, more than enough to finish off overloaded enemy ships.",,,
apex_boa,SHIP,"Much less exotic than other Collective phase warships, Boas were designed as destroyer hunters. Their heavy armament and powerful flux core enables them to tear up similarly-sized combatants, though their high cost, relative fragility, and lack of a cruiser-sized targeting core limits their effectiveness.

While the Boa-class hulls are largely considered to be an ""old man's ship"" in the CDF, this is a bit of a misnomer, as the design is only 65 cycles old, a far cry from hulls that predate the Collapse. Unlike most of the Persean Sector, almost the entire Collective navy consists of designs created within the last century. The early Collective made deliberate attempts to prevent loss of knowledge and expertise during the Collapse and subsequent Vela Labor War, and as a result managed to retain significantly more shipbuilding and design capability than other polities. ",,,
,,,,,
apex_quasar,SHIP,An enormous amalgamation of several Collective warships. Design and origin are unknown.,,,
apex_bounty_odomodo,SHIP,"A strange rebuild of a Collective Komodo-class heavy cruiser, apparently the result of joining two mirrored halves together to form a symmetrical ship. The right half of the ship is clearly from a standard Komodo, but the origin of the left half remains unknown.",,,
apex_bounty_kommok,SHIP,"A mysterious rebuild of a Collective Komodo-clas heavy cruiser, apparently the result of joining two mirrored halves together to form a symmetrical ship. While the left half of the ship is obviously half of a standard Komodo, where the mirrored right half came from is a mystery.",,,
,,,,,
# Fighters,,,,,
apex_fighter_whiptail,SHIP,"A large drone bomber with a powerful anti-shield payload.

A simple drone bomber developed alongside the Tegu, the Whiptail launches a lightweight version of the Arcspike canister. While extremely simple to produce and maintain, it is oversized for most fighter nanoforges, which require some reconfiguration to fit the Whiptail's wide frame.",,,
apex_fighter_gecko,SHIP,"High-performance interceptor drones with tracking projectile weapons, Geckos easily shred missiles and enemy strikecraft while keeping human pilots out of harm's way.

During development, the Gecko faced significant opposition from the pilot's union, as it was intended to be the first drone fighter the Collective would deploy in large numbers. This would put nearly every interceptor pilot out of a job- something the union obviously opposed. Following the Battle of Onyx Station, in which the Collective lost nearly half of its active fighter pilots, the drone program went ahead without complaints.",,,
apex_fighter_anole,SHIP,"A heavy drone fighter with excellent armor and firepower. Anoles can shrug off all but the heaviest point defense weaponry, and mount enough weaponry to seriously threaten mid-sized warships.

The second output of Apex's drone fighter program, the Anole was designed to tear through the lightly-armored, high-tech ships favored by Tri-Tachyon associates. High-grade burst coilguns and an integrated fusion beam ensure a swift death for most frigates and destroyers, and the drone control system means that losses can be easily absorbed. The downside, of course, is that the Anole is vastly more complex to operate and produce than most other strikecraft.",,,
apex_fighter_chameleon,SHIP,"An affordable support drone designed to defend larger ships against small, lightly-armored targets, the Chameleon is affectionately referred to as the ""flyswatter"" by deck crews.

The result of a failed attempt to produce an advanced long-range fighter driven by a delta-level AI, Chameleons were originally intended to operate in large packs without support from line ships. However, during initial tests, it was discovered that the drones' synthetic minds were overly protective of their parent vessels, and would frequently refuse to leave their carriers behind in order to engage targets. Instead of starting the AI development from scratch, the drones were redesigned as medium-cost support fighters. 

Unlike the Collective's other automated fighters, the Chameleon is remotely operated rather than directly controlled, since their short operating range minimizes lightspeed transmission delays. This allows the vessel's AI to learn and develop over time, rather than having a new one spun up each time a replacement chassis is fabricated. Long-serving Chameleon AIs are known for having a notably dog-like demeanor, and react well to positive reinforcement and attention. The operating manual suggests treating the drone as if it was a particularly large and friendly dog unaware that it was a multi-ton war machine.",,,
apex_fighter_tegu,SHIP,"A resilient bomber with a potent armor-stripping payload. Equipped with a simple drone guidance system to prevent needless pilot casualties.

While the Tegu's angular hull implies an advanced design, it is little more than an engine, armor plating, several cameras, and a high-end personal computer. Since its torpedo's guidance requires no external input, the most complicated part of the drone's programming is the landing sequence. Deck crews have been known to order damaged Tegus to self-destruct rather than trying to deal with a faulty drone attempting to land.",,,

# Systems,,,,,
apex_microburn,SHIP_SYSTEM,Provides an extremely short burst of forward thrust and turning speed.,,,
apex_damper,SHIP_SYSTEM,Reduces incoming damage by dilating time. Increases local timeflow by 50% and reduces damage taken by 70%. Disables shields and prevents hard flux dissipation.,,,
apex_remote_damper,SHIP_SYSTEM,"Briefly improves fighter performance and resilience by dilating time. Fighters have their timeflow increased by 50% and take 70% less damage. Temporarily disables fighter shields, if present.",,,
apex_inertial_skimmer,SHIP_SYSTEM,"Provides a very short bonus to maneuverability, followed by a high-speed movement burst in the current travel direction.",,,
apex_cruisemode,SHIP_SYSTEM,"Engages the long-range travel drive. Massively increases maximum speed, but decreases turning speed and disables weapons and shields.",,,
apex_arc_mine,SHIP_SYSTEM,"Launches several arcmines from built-in launchers. Each mine generates arcs to nearby hostile ships, missiles, and fighters.",,,
apex_phasebanish,SHIP_SYSTEM,"Banishes random nearby enemy missiles and projectiles into phase space, never to be seen again. Heavily damages enemy fighters within range.",,,
apex_rapid_loader,SHIP_SYSTEM,"Instantly fills weapon magazines with 20 seconds worth of ammo regeneration, up to their maximum capacity.",,,
apex_heavy_skimmer,SHIP_SYSTEM,"Provides a short bonus to maneuverability, followed by a high-speed movement burst in the current travel direction.",,,
apex_bifurcator,SHIP_SYSTEM,Causes projectiles to occasionally summon a duplicate of themselves.,,,
apex_thorns,SHIP_SYSTEM,An exotic distortion field reduces incoming damage and generates homing energy projectiles when hit. Disables weapons and shields while active.,,,
apex_excessionsys,SHIP_SYSTEM,"Shunts a large amount of flux into the breach core, expanding the captured hyperspace tear. Massively increases core charge generation, but prevents phasing while active.",,,
apex_bounty_superdamper,SHIP_SYSTEM,Reduces incoming damage by 95%. Disables weapons and shields while active.,,,
apex_uplink,SHIP_SYSTEM,"Improves the defenses of allies within 1600su, reducing shield damage taken by 20% and increasing armor effectiveness by 33%. Prevents hard flux dissipation while active.",,,
apex_pursuit_jets,SHIP_SYSTEM,"Increases non-missile weapon damage by 33%, and improves speed and maneuverability. The speed bonus is strongest when moving forwards.",,,
apex_gravity_shield,SHIP_SYSTEM,"Diverts incoming projectiles, decelerates missiles, and reduces incoming beam damage by 33% for a short duration.",,,
,,,,,
# Weapons,,,,,
apex_qgp_small,WEAPON,"Fires a small pulse of decoherent quark-gluon plasma at targets. The plasma is mostly ineffective against shields or armor, but devastating to less resilient internal compartments. In the interest of flexibility, it can accept both standard high-energy power linkages and mechanically-fed power cells.

Quark-gluon plasma generators are fairly simple in theory. Particle accelerators collide heavy nuclei at relativistic speeds, exceeding the Hagedorn temperature and producing a mass of disparate quarks and gluons. In a quark-gluon pulser, this mass of plasma is then magnetically propelled at a target. The extreme difficulty in containing the plasma means that it lacks power when faced with armor or shields, but it can easily carve through unprotected hull.",,,
apex_qgp_med,WEAPON,"Fires a large pulse of decoherent quark-gluon plasma at targets. The plasma is mostly ineffective against shields or armor, but devastating to less resilient internal compartments. Like its smaller cousin, it can accept both standard high-energy power linkages and mechanically-fed power cells.

Quark-gluon plasma generators are fairly simple in theory. Particle accelerators collide heavy nuclei at relativistic speeds, exceeding the Hagedorn temperature and producing a mass of disparate quarks and gluons. In a quark-gluon pulser, this mass of plasma is then magnetically propelled at a target. The extreme difficulty in containing the plasma means that it lacks power when faced with armor or shields, but it can easily carve through unprotected hull.",,,
apex_qgpd_s_flak,WEAPON,"A quark-gluon plasma generator specialized for point defense. The volatile packets of superheated plasma it fires are very effective against missiles, but much less so against armored or shielded targets.

Functioning on similar principles as the Collective's ubiquitous magnetic projector nozzles, quark-gluon PD weapons can remotely affect their projectiles. For low-power, mechanically-fed ballistic mounts, this consists of using a small secondary charge pack present in each power cell to remotely detonate the plasma through magnetic interference. High-power energy mounts instead use their abundance of energy to remotely guide their projectiles, ensuring that shots connect with all but the fastest targets.",,,
apex_qgpd_m_flak,WEAPON,"A heavy quark-gluon plasma generator specialized for point defense. The volatile packets of superheated plasma it fires are very effective against missiles, but much less so against armored or shielded targets.

Despite their preference for high-performance strikecraft in lieu of heavy point defense, the Fleet Design Bureau recognized the need for a heavier point-defense solution, as the low rate of fire of Quark-Gluon PDs meant that they struggled to deal with massed missile attacks. Expanding the small weapon to a medium mount offered acceptable performance for relatively little development time, and thus the simplistic Heavy Quark-Gluon PD was born.",,,
apex_disruptor,WEAPON,"Fires self-propagating spatial disruptions that strain shield generators and shear through armor. Inflicts ruinous damage to unprotected hull.

One of the few weapons in the Apex arsenal that predate the Collapse, the Disruption Propagator is poorly-understood and difficult to maintain. Internally, it shares several design similarities with the Plasma Cannon, producing a mini-universe anomaly and propelling it towards a target. However, the disruptor produces a fixed instability in the anomaly during the firing sequnce, resulting in a semi-stable spatial tear that quickly subsumes the anomaly. This tear is only stable in vacuum, and collapses violently when impacting anything with sufficient density. Notably, most starship internals lack the density to immediately trigger a collapse, allowing the tear to penetrate deep inside a target and shred internal machinery before collapsing. Furthermore, the rubber-band effect of spacetime returning to its normal geometry produces extreme shear forces, which can both disrupt shield generators and physically slice off armor plating.",,,
apex_nanoacid_torp_rack,WEAPON,"A frighteningly fast unguided torpedo with a unique corrosive warhead. The nanoacid compound is produced through a reaction shortly before impact, as the casing can only contain it for a fraction of a second. An internal magazine provides more ammo than other torpedoes, at the cost of lower rate of fire.

Unlike most specialized anti-armor weapons (such as the popular Breach SRM), nanoacid is perfectly capable of eating through a ship's superstructure after melting through any armor. Many unfortunate captains have breathed a sigh of relief that a nanoacid torpedo salvo didn't finish them off, only for their ship to break apart beneath them as the acid liquifies key structural components.",,,
apex_nanoacid_torp_pod,WEAPON,"An enlarged Nanoacid Torpedo launcher with a sizable magazine. For safety reasons, only a single torpedo is readied at once, though the reloading mechanism can replace it much faster than most other launchers.

Nanoacid has a well-earned reputation for being a particularly fearsome compound. As such, weapons that employ it have aggressive safety measures designed to ensure that the nanoacid cannot be accidentally produced inside the ship.",,,
apex_emp_laser,WEAPON,"A medium-range beam laser effective at suppressing enemy targets. Not particularly threatening without fire from other weapons.

Functioning on similar principles as the Tachyon Inverter, the Inversion Beam drives a graviton stream through a tiny pocket of inverted spacetime. The resulting beam consists of myriad exotic particles, and produces a mild EMP effect when it touches normal matter.",,,
apex_fusion_small,WEAPON,"Essentially a weaponized version of the fusion ignition device used in many starship reactors, fusion beams use their target's armor and superstructure as reaction mass.

As with many Apex military innovations, the fusion beam was explicitly designed to 'punch up,' countering heavier assets from the Collective's rivals. Given the relatively light armor of Tri-Tachyon high-tech ships, it has been speculated that fusion beams were developed to counter the armor-focused fleets of the Hegemony and Persean League. Collective diplomats fervently deny any such rumors, stating that the Collective's specialized anti-armor weaponry is simply a key part of their overall fleet design. Leaked fleet exercises, however, reveal that Collective Defense Force admirals occasionally train against orange-flagged simulated opposing forces with heavy armor.",,,
apex_fusion_medium,WEAPON,"Triggers a fusion detonation on contact with hull or armor. Denser and more heavily-armored targets produce a more powerful detonation.

Two fusion beams squeezed into a single armature and supplied with additional power, the Twin Fusion Beam offers better range and a more efficient fusion reaction than its smaller sibling.",,,
apex_fusion_large,WEAPON,"Hideously effective against unshielded ships, a single burst from this oversized fusion beam is enough to slice through all but the heaviest armor.

Quite literally the result of doubling most of the dimensions of the Twin Fusion Beam, the Superheavy Fusion Beam set records for the shortest time between the drawing board and official deployment.",,,
apex_tachyon,WEAPON,"Delivers a spread of high-energy tachyon bolts, effective against both armor and shields.

Based on the same principles as the Tachyon Lance, the Tachyon Inverter bifurcates the reaction stream and directs both halves inwards towards a nucleation point. The gravitic cavitation effect caused by the extreme tachyon flux then produces small bundles of inverted spacetime filled with tachyons and anti-plasma, which are propelled towards the target by a simple electromagnetic armature. The exteme charge on the anomalies produces the distinctive spread pattern, as the identical charges repel each other.",,,
apex_haymarket,WEAPON,"A high-performance railgun that delivers a steady stream of charged kinetic slugs.

A remarkably simple and robust weapon, the Haymarket is a modern iteration of a time-tested design. Unlike the Collective's other kinetic weaponry, which uses frictionless coilgun designs, the Haymarket uses a traditional linear motor to simultaneously charge and accelerate a capacitve slug. While extremely simple to operate, it has significant maintenance requirements, as the rails must be replaced and recalibrated frequently.",,,
apex_arcspike,WEAPON,"Arcspike missiles use a ""dirty"" engine that builds up a significant graviton charge, which is then dispersed into the target on impact. Their high speed makes them very difficult to intercept.

Rumor has it that the Arcspike was specifically engineered as a counter to Fortress Shield systems, to take down TriTachyon's most vaunted capital ship. While certainly highly effective against advanced shield systems, the Arcspike has yet to dethrone the ubiquitious Sabot SRM as a generalist shield-breaker.",,,
apex_arcspike_canister,WEAPON,"Launches an unpowered canister containing Arcspike SRMs. Rapidly disperses its payload when a target enters range.

Remarkably simple to construct, Arcspike canisters consist of nothing more than an armored shell, ten Arcspike SRMs, and packing foam. Gunnery crews insist that despite the visual similarities, ordnance packing foam is completely unrelated to generic floral foam.",,,
apex_arcstorm_canister,WEAPON,"Launches an unpowered canister that fires a stream of medium-range anti-shield missiles when a target enters range.

While some weapon designers decry upscaling as ""a lazy cop-out that just bloats weapon catalogs,"" there is little argument to be had about its effectiveness in the case of the Arcstorm. Larger submunitions grant increased range with identical engine performance, and the larger canister provides much greater shield-breaking power.",,,
apex_coilgun_small,WEAPON,"A simple coilgun with trickle-charging capacitors. Offers a bit of extra up-front damage and high accuracy.

A frictionless linear motor, coilguns make attractive weapons due to their near-zero maintenance requirements and inert ammunition.",,,
apex_coilgun_medium,WEAPON,"A twin-linked coilgun with trickle-charging capacitors. Fires a steady stream of light flechettes.

Popular among gunnery crews for its almost nonexistent maintenance requirements, the Burst Coilgun's only moving parts are its aiming motors and ammunition feed, both of which have an expected service lifetime of well over a million shots. Nearly all of its operating complexity is due to the exacting precision requirements of its ammunition, which requires a finely-calibrated ammunition autoforge.",,,
apex_nanogun_small,WEAPON,"A high-spec anti-armor cannon with a special corrosive payload. Effective against even the most heavily armored targets, but correspondingly expensive to mount.

There is a rumor among Pather sects that nanoacid was dreamed up by a corrupted (or perfectly functional, depending on the sect) AI core. Collective captains assigned to Pather suppression duties are keen to remark that the existence of nanoacid is surely proof that the Pathers' God is impotent, uncaring, or both.",,,
apex_nanogun_medium,WEAPON,"A high-end anti-armor cannon that can melt through even the heaviest armor with a unique corrosive payload. Larger acid mixing chambers significantly improve efficiency over its smaller cousin.

Folk legend has it that nanoacid was originally concocted by a daring group of union miners on Glass during a strike, then thrown in bottles to melt down police mechs. While producing nanoacid is relatively simple if one knows the formula, serious analysts consider this origin story highly unlikely- the hypercorrosive nature of the substance makes hand-producing it suicidal. Interestingly, while the effects of it are certainly known (and appropriately feared), the exact operating mechanism of the compound is poorly understood due to how aggressively it attacks both scientific instruments and unfortunate researchers.",,,
apex_fusion_fighter,WEAPON,A miniaturized fusion beam integrated into the Anole's hull.,,,
apex_coilgun_fighter,WEAPON,An integrated coilgun. Fires in bursts.,,,
apex_qgp_fighter,WEAPON,"An integrated Quark-Gluon PD system. Has an impressive damage output for its size, but is relatively ineffective against armored targets.",,,
apex_arcspike_canister_fighter,WEAPON,A lightweight Arcspike canister designed for use on the Whiptail. Carries fewer submunitions than ship-mounted canisters.,,,
apex_dartgun,WEAPON,"Fires energized vibrating darts that create a destructive resonance in their targets. Repeated impacts amplify and refine the resonance, substantially improving the destructive effects.

Operating on a similar basis as shattering a wine glass with the proper note, the Harmonic Dart Cannon uses advanced (and notoriously tempermental) computer systems to predict the proper ""note"" to play to shatter an entire warship. Those fortunate enough to be on the receiving end and survive have compared the experience to being boiled alive by a piano.

Among gunnery crews, there is a tradition where the gun's ""key"" is determined through a secretive process that involves significant amounts of alcohol. A gun in a minor key is considered bad luck, and must be kept appeased through regular ""sacrificial offerings"" of maintenance (or the occasional hapless ensign).",,,
apex_sledgehammer_small,WEAPON,"Easily identifiable by the green bulk of their nanolaminate plating, Sledgehammers are durable anti-hull missiles that inflict lethal damage to undefended ships, but are relatively ineffective against fast or well-armored targets.

Despite their rather plain exterior, Sledgehammer MRMs use a particularly exotic phase-static warhead. Roughly analogous to static electricity buildup, the warhead ""scrapes"" against phase space as the missile flies, building up a devastating phasic charge that is released on impact. This process produces a significant amount of drag, which results in the Sledgehammer's distinctive lack of speed.",,,
apex_sledgehammer_med,WEAPON,"A trio of Sledgehammer launch tubes fed by an internal magazine. Sledgehammers inflict massive damage to hull and are extremely durable, but faster targets can usually evade the ponderous missiles.

One of the few missiles in the sector to actually feature dedicated armor, Sledgehammers are equipped a thin layer of the Collective's signature green nanolaminate plating. While the armor is too thin to properly ablate damage like the thicker plating used on warships, it still massively enhances the missle's durability.",,,
apex_sledgehammer_large,WEAPON,"Septuple Sledgehammer launch tubes crammed into a large standardized mount. Capable of dealing massive damage to targets that cannot evade or intercept the slow-moving missiles.

A simple missile launcher at first glance, the single sticking point of this oversized clump of missile tubes is the autoloading mechanism. Sledgehammer missiles are particularly large, and size constraints in the mount mean that only one missile can pass through the interface at a time, limiting the overall fire rate quite severely.",,,
apex_tachyondriver_s,WEAPON,"A downscaled version of the Tachyon Driver designed for use in smaller ships. Compensates for its low projectile velocity with excellent range and efficiency.

Not everything can be scaled down easily, and the Light Tachyon Driver suffers from this quite heavily- the tachyon pulse generator used in its larger cousin is vastly weaker when miniaturized.",,,
apex_tachyondriver_m,WEAPON,"Fires a wedge-shaped blast of small tachyon bolts. Compensates for its poor projectile velocity and lackluster anti-armor performance with above-average range and efficiency.

A complex weapon best explained using a blob of modeling clay and a potato masher, the tachyon driver ""extrudes"" a series of tachyon bolts from a short-lived tachyon pulse. The ensuing projectiles are relatively low-powered, but remain coherent over a much longer distance than most other energy weapons.",,,
apex_swarmer,WEAPON,An integrated Swarmer SRM launcher.,,,
apex_qgp_support,WEAPON,An integrated Quark-Gluon Pulser that takes advantage of the Chameleon's large frame. The larger firing armature improves accuracy and adds an instability to the projectile that produces EMP effects on impact.,,,

apex_nanoacid_torp_single,WEAPON,A single nanoacid torpedo equipped with a rudimentary optical seeker and gimballed thruster. Slower and less durable than the unguided version.,,,
apex_nanoacid_torp_barrage,WEAPON,"Fires a rapid barrage of three nanoacid torpedoes. High-grade reloading systems and a sizeable internal magazine provide excellent sustained firepower.

When nanoacid torpedo launchers were in their testing phase, they were only produced in small and medium mounts. Testing captains repeatedly expressed a desire for ""a Hammer Barrage that fires these things"", and the Fleet Design Bureau was quickly convinced of the error of their ways.",,,
apex_tachyonshredder,WEAPON,A powerful spinal energy weapon that rends spacetime to produce high-energy projectiles.,,,
apex_ultrachrome,WEAPON,A specialized and extremely efficient siege weapon designed to disrupt closely-packed power cores and shield generators using exotic multi-phase plasma projectors.,,,

apex_design,FACTION,"The Apex Design Collective is a fairly insular polity originally founded as the Apex Design Corporation. Pre-collapse, it was a secretive military-industrial corporation that competed for bids to develop and manufacture high-spec warships for the Domain. Following the collapse, increasingly violent labor conflicts resulted in the expulsion (or execution) of the company's corporate masters, and the reformation of the corporation into a fully worker-owned entity. Today, Apex is more government than corporation, and its aggressively pro-worker attitude frequently puts it at odds with the sector's more capitalistic polities.  As such, it maintains a large, cutting-edge fleet which it uses to prevent any external interference. While Apex firmly denies that it uses its military for offensive actions, it's a poorly-kept secret that most of its ""foreign union organizers"" have extensive military training.

Despite its progressive outlook, life in the Collective isn't utopian, but it is slightly better than average. Wages are decent, hours are good, and overtime pay even better. Shortages are fairly rare, thanks to the Collective policy of self-sufficiency, and government-sanctioned oppression is limited to Luddic sects and corporate infiltrators. Most attractive to prospective immigrants, however, is the Collective's refusal to recognize contracts from other polities that are ""unfair"" or ""exploitative."" The list of said polities is, unsurprisingly, composed almost entirely of Apex's enemies.",,,
