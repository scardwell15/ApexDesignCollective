- chameleon support fighter: reduced weapon range from 1200 to 1000. I think I balanced these off of the xyphos having 1200 range? but these deal hard flux, so...
- gecko interceptor: significantly increased rate of fire because they were getting bullied by cheaper interceptors
- anole heavy fighter: weapons now generate flux, somewhat limiting sustained damage output
- tachyon inverter: look, I was wrong when I increased it to 800 range. I'm sorry. It will happen again. It's 700 now.
- gharial and komodo: reduced damper uptime from 5.2s to 3s.
- apotheosis and apotheosis(RG): adjusted DP values- regular one was 37 and the RG one was 38, despite being a downgrade. Regular is now 38, RG is now 37.
- active flare projector: reduced number of flares for larger ships

todo:
- Mission ("Slugfest"): Capital on capital action. Both sides are playable in this one. Winning with a good score unlocks a start option for both factions. (apex oddy, tritach summit?)
- fix cryocooled not blocking vaingloria armor
- fix vayra's sector factions using fighter_doctrine skill
- arcspike srm pod extra space after comma
- gharial destroyer beamer autofit has LRPD
- reduce distortion size on tachyon inverter

Changes:
- Tweaked tachyon inverter vfx
= fixed a missing rank/post in a bounty
- fixed a missing string in a hullmod
- fixed a number of sprite offset issues (thanks nes!)
- fix python with brdy_iwcannon/iwshard (ironweaver)
